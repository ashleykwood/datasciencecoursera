Within this repository are the two files to generate a shiny app, ui.R and server.R.
The shiny app will give the user a choice of 20 national parks. The user can select as many or as few of the parks as desired. The user can also choose a range of years from 2007 to 2016.
Upon input from the user, the app will generate an interactive plot of the number of recreational visits per year of each park selected.

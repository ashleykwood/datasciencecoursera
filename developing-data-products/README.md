This repository contains files relevant to Coursera's Developing Data Products Course Project.

There are the two files mandatory to create a shiny app, ```ui.R``` and ```server.R```.
There is a third file, ```Annual Visitation By Park.csv```, which contains the data used in generating the plot within the app.
Note that the csv file was obtained online from nps.org.
